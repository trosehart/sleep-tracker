# sleep_record.c
This program records data on sleep patterns.  Using two ultrasonic sensors 
and two sound sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi, it records when sounds 
are made and measures distance to see motion with the ultrasonics.  

It records the data in a file for stats, then creates a report on the data.
